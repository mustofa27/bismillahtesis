13_T1-Req-uji13;The only requirements besides having an iPhone will be having a Twitter account and internet acces;1
13_T1-Req-uji13;The Twitter client will use several different data objects while in operation.;1
13_T1-Req-uji13;The data objects that are while used inside the Application will be the main driving force of the client.;1
13_T1-Req-uji13;They will provide all the information the user wants to see based on what he or she inputs;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;The user is the main data object of the client�s system.;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;The user will log into the client by supplying a username and password.;0

13_T1-Req-uji13;A Tweet can be any sort of text as long as it is under the maximum number of characters allowed per Tweet.;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;A newly entered Tweet will appear on the user�s Twitter page upon submission.;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;Other pages on Twitter are also data objects.;1

13_T1-Req-uji13;The client would not be appealing if only the user�s page could be accessed, so ability to access other pages is essential.;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;A trending topics page will be very useful to the user because it will keep them up to date on what is popular.;0

13_T1-Req-uji13;The client will be designed specifically for the iPhone/iPod Touch but it will retain the same functionality on the iPad.;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;The Twitter client will rely heavily on the Twitter API for retrieval of user data.;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;The client must work closely with the Twitter systems to authenticate and deliver content.;1
13_T1-Req-uji13;The client will be designed to work with the latest API available and compatibility is guaranteed with and iOS device running the latest version of iOS.;1
13_T1-Req-uji13;The client will utilize a common design theme throughout the entire system.;0
13_T1-Req-uji13;The application will contain multiple views, each of which will serve some primary function.;0
