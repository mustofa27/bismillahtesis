11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This software is being developed to for customer Xuan Gu, an employee for the CISE Department at the University of Florida.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;TA1 is part of a four-part project consisting of a Faculty, Admin, TA1 and TA2.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The TA1 interface will allow the user to edit the number of TA slots for a particular course as well as assign/update TA applicant categories.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;There will also be a secure login before any of these interfaces are accessible.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The format of this SRS is simple.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Bold face and indentation is used on general topics and or specific points of interest.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The remainder of the document will be written using the standard font, New Times Roman.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This document is intended to be read by the customer Xuan Gu.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This is a technical document and the terms should be understood by the customer.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The scope of this project includes our group of developers assisted by our customer, Xuan.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The scope thus far has been the completion of the basic interfaces that will be used to build the system.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The database used, has been set up and given the necessary permissions.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The constraints felt thus far by the group have only been our weekly story cards, the end-to-end side of the interface, and our first release, scheduled for February 11, 2004.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Resources have been used from Dr. Cubert’s website, www.cise.ufl.edu/~rmc/se/, and this SRS was modeled after one found online at http://www.processimpact.com/process_assets/srs_template.doc.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The TA1 Project is a new product that is part of a larger, more complete product for our customer.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;It will provide the faculty a way of viewing all of the TA’s information that is necessary in order to make a decision on every TA’s status.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This project has three pages that are part of TA1, which is part of the larger product.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The first page is a login interface that will only allow access from the proper users.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The second page displays the available classes based on a certain semester and the course enrollment for a particular class.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The third and final page displays information about TA’s, their status, and any special notes that might’ve been posted about them.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The user classes will be TA1, TA2, Administration, and Faculty.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This product is web-based and will be hosted by a web server on the CISE website (www.cise.ufl.edu).;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This product can be viewed by any web browser, and has been tested for compliance with Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Opera.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;There are no constraints at this point in time.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The user documentation can be found in this SRS.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;We assume that extra documentation beyond this SRS would not be necessary in order for the user to utilize this product.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This feature will give the user a secure and simple login screen.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;It is based on professor Cubert’s exclusionary principle.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This means rather than creating try catches for a handful of error types, it just has only a handful of available and possible inputs, to prevent any improper logging in, which might cause unexpected errors, and therefore limiting the system’s capabilities.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;It will consist of two basic fields, Username and Password.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;There are two buttons: Login and Lost or Forgot Password.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Login will submit the entered data for approval followed by access, and the forgot password will direct the user to access his/her password which has been forgotten.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The most important function is to only grant access to users that are listed in the database.;1
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The customer will provide the information on who will be allowed access.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;To implement the security, the web page must check the database to see if the Username and Password are valid.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;If they are not, the user will receive an “Invalid login. Please try again.” response.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This feature will allow the user to edit the number of TA slots for a specific course.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The user will be given a list of course numbers and names for a given semester.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;They will also be provided with the number of students enrolled in each specific class.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This interface will consist of basic fields for the user to enter information.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Also, information about each person in the database that is listed will be shown if the mouse is highlighting a name for one second.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This helps alleviate some time when the user is searching for data because it lessens the usage of the submit button because the data has already been found.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Additionally, once logged in, upon hitting the back button and reentering the site will not call for another log in screen.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;It will therefore take you to the following page of options.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;To use this interface there will be many functional requirements.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The main function will use PHP to pull the course information off of the database.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This feature will not only provide the user with the general information on all the applicants, but also allow them to assign and update the TA categories.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The user will be given a list of names and UFID’s of all the applicants to their courses.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;They will also be given the ability to sort the applicants in order of UFID or alphabetically by their last names.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The user will be able to change the status of the applicants as needed.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This interface will depend mostly on retrieving information from the database.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;PHP will be integrated into the HTML and will retrieve needed information for the interface.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The site will be xhtml1.1 and css compliant.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The first interface is the log-in screen.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;This is where the user has a specific Username and Password so that they can gain access to the database.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Next is the TA Slots interface.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;You can choose which semester’s classes you would like to view and are able to update any of the categories displayed in the columns.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The next and final interface is the “assign/update” page.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Though not necessarily interfacing with the hardware, the system must make use with an internet connection.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The system uses an internet connection to connect to the database.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;The code itself though, does not specifically direct the network controllers to do any work.;1
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Along with the internet connection, the system makes indirect use of an internet browser.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Outside of the HTML code and PHP, the code doesn’t tell any software, including the browser, what to do.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Access to the database should be restricted to people that are required to view information about TA’s.;0
11_5hlmnSRS_uji11;Passwords and ID’s should be regulated to be at least a certain length and must contain non-alphanumeric characters in both the password and ID.;0

29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;PHP IDE’s main user objective is to answer all PHP developer needs.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;A PHP project contains source code and related files for maintaining a PHP Application. A PHP project can be organized in two different ways using the project as the source container. Using source folders inside the project as the source container.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;"A wizard is available for creating a PHP project. The wizard can be access by the Project Wizard in eclipse (File>>New>>Project). In the Project Wizard there will be a project type named ""PHP Project"" that will launch the create PHP project wizard.";0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;When in the PHP perspective a Create PHP project wizard icon will be on the tool bar and a File>>New>>PHP Project will exist on the menu.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;PHP Version – The user should be able to choose between PHP4 and PHP5 and by that change all related components: code assist, syntax coloring and PHP functions.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;ASP tags support - support ASP tags as PHP tags for all PHP actions and parsing. The following tags will be supported.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Default File Encoding – The project will support a default encoding that will be used for all files created in the project. Location – The location of the project. The default location when a project is created is the eclipse workspace. When a location is specified, any directory/file at that location will be part of the project. Only the developer’s data files will reside at the location. Eclipse internal project files will reside in a eclipse internal directory.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The PHP project will support a properties menu item to display the properties of a project.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Files can be added to a project by the following methods. Import from File System Drag and Drop.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;"Any file that is not added to a project using the ""New PHP file Wizard"" will be given the default file encoding of the project.";0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;A project can be saved, retrieved, and synchronized with a CVS repository. All the properties of the project and files in the project (encoding, version, etc) will be saved, retrieved, and synchronized with the repository.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;These are the menu items that affect a PHP project. There may be other items on the Project Menu because eclipse supports other types of projects. The Project Menu items vary based on the project selected.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;During typing the PHP inspector is run and highlighting of errors (a squiggly line under the code) occurs for the file. Errors detected during typing are not displayed in the problems view. The build options in the project menu determine when the eclipse builder is run. The eclipse builder is potentially a long running operation. Depending on the changes made, every file in the workspace could be rebuilt. Eclipse attempts to determine the files that have changed based on the project dependencies. The eclipse builder is run as a background task so that the developer can continue to work. Problems detected during the build phase will show up in the problems view and will be highlighted using a squiggly line under the code.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;When a project is closed, it can no longer be changed and its resources no longer appear in the Package Explorer, Project Outline View, etc. To re-open the project, select the project in the PHP Explorer View and click on Open Project. Eclipse doesn’t have a concept of .prj files.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Following are the right click menu items for a project. Some of the menu items may be handled by the low level eclipse infrastructure and not require implementation by the PHP project. Other are open issues to be resolved, but are listed here since they will show up in the Menu unless some specific action is taken to turn them off.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;When a location is specified, any directory/file at that location will be part of the project. Only the developer’s data files will reside at the location. Eclipse internal project files will reside in a eclipse internal directory.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The ability to create a PHP file with the following properties will be supported.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;A Local history of a file is maintained when you create or modify a file. Each time you edit and save a file, a copy of it is saved. This allows you to compare your current file state to a previous state, or replace the file with a previous state. Each state in the local history is identified by the date and time the file was saved.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;If the project is being maintained in CVS, the option to compare, replace, restore, etc the file from CVS will be supported. Anytime a PHP file is synchronized with a CVS repository, the properties of a file are transferred (encoding).;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The PHP Inspector is responsible for analyzing all PHP code files in an Eclipse Platform. The PHP inspector should inspect the following: PHP Elements. PHP classes – including the following data. File name. Positions. Modifier.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;This is the source of all PHP language classes, functions and constants. This data should come in the;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;format of PHP files that can be editable.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The file should be located as part of the plugin/installation directory in a lib directory.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Two files should be included: phpFunctions4.php phpFunctions5.php;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Any change in these files will effect the following in all projects:;1
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;PHP Editor should extend the Web Tools text editor and should inherit all its capabilities and actions. The PHP Editor should allow working on more then one programming language at the same time (PHP & HTML);0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Syntax Coloring – PHP Editor should color several languages at the same time. The Syntax Coloring should be customizable through the Editor preferences.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Should support both PHP 4 and PHP 5 (see PHP Project – PHP Version);0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Should color: default text, keywords, variables, numbers, strings, herdocs,;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Single-line comments, Multi-line comments, PHP tags, function names.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Supports both PHP 4 and PHP 5 (see PHP Project – PHP Version);0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Support Auto Activate if possible and suitable for Eclipse (with size limit and time delay);0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Suggests and completes classes, functions, variables, constants and keywords, PHPDoc tags, PHPDoc variables;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Shows function signature while calling the function.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The PHP editor will have a wizard that will support the following search options Classes Functions Constants Variables.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The scope of files searched can be limited to Workspace, Selected Resources, Enclosing Projects, and Working Set. When the search is completed the PHP will open a search view with the results. Files when opened in the editor will be annotated with the search result.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Annotation is a piece of information attached to a certain region of a text document. Annotations are shown in a vertical ruler on the left side of the text, an overview ruler on the right side of the text, as a highlighted word or as colored squigglies underneath text. Annotations are largely dependent on the kind of document being edited.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The editor will support moving to the next/previous annotations by icons on the Tool Bar and menu items. The editor will support the preferences set in annotation preference wizard supported by the Workbench.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Quick Diff provides color-coded change indication while you are typing. When the mouse cursor is placed over a change in the vertical ruler, a hover displays the original content, which can be restored using the ruler's context menu. Quick Diff will support both local history and CVS.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The PHP Editor will support the standard eclipse Key Bindings. Some examples are below.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The Outline view displays a Tree representation of the contents of the editor that is currently visible in the editor area of the workbench. For PHP files, the Outline should display elements like classes, functions, variables, included files, and constants. It should optionally also display the content outside the PHP areas (ex. HTML, XML, CSS, JavaScript).;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Global Menus: Collapse all, Expand all, Show PHP/HTML;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;PHP nodes: Add/Delete/Rename class, function, variable, included file, constant (in the long future);0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Other content: Provide default behavior that is available on the other editors. For example, HTML content nodes should have the same context menu when in an HTML file.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Selection: Selecting the Tree node in the Outline view highlights the represented element on the editor. This should also work in the other direction, meaning that the Outline view should highlight the node represented by the area under the editor’s caret.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The Project Outline View is a new View to the Eclipse Platform. This View is very similar to the Outline;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;View except that it should display the elements of the project correspondent to the opened file.;1
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;All other functionality should be identical to the Outline View. This view is basically gathering of all Outline Views data of the entire project files. Similar to the Package Explorer from the JDT, the PHP Explorer shows the PHP element hierarchy of the PHP projects in the workbench. It provides a PHP-specific view of the resources shown in the Navigator.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The element hierarchy is derived from the project's build paths.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The PHP Explorer View will support using Working Set to determine the projects that are shown.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;The actions (right click menus) of the Explorer view are derived form the Project actions (appears in section 3.1 under Right Click Menu Items).;1
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;"The Problems view should display all PHP errors and warnings. Should include ""include files"" problem (in the future). All errors and warnings will have a description, resource, folder, and location associated with them. Resource refers to the php file containing the problem. Folder refers to the directory containing the php file. Location will refer to the line number containing the problem.";0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;When a user clicks on a problem in the problems view, the php file containing the error or warning will be displayed in the editor.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;When a user clicks on a missing include file, a file wizard will appear to add the file to the project.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Syntax Coloring – customized syntax highlighting for PHPDoc tags and their values (see Editor – Syntax Coloring).;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Inspection – The value of the following tags should be inspected: abstract, access, author, copyright, deprecated, example, exception, final, global, ignore, internal, link, magic, name, return, package, param, see, since, static, staticvar, subpackage, throws, todo, var and version.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Code Assist – for the list of tags appears above there should be code assist as well.;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;Adding description Outline view – right click action to add description to the selected data Project Outline View - right click action to add description to the selected data Code Assist – Button and shortcut to add description to the selected data in the list (if possible, will be added in future versions).;0
29_PDT-O7SRS-uji29;In a document with PHP as well as other content (i.e. HTML), each content should have a Formatting strategy. The strategy for foreign content (i.e. HTML) should be the same as those provided by standalone editors. This section emphasized on the Formatting options for the PHP content and Doc areas.;0
